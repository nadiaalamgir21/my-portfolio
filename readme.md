# My Portfolio

Hi my name is Nadia, this project is my first portfolio from scratch and it has been an amazing experience. I have successfully created this project to be responsive and functional. 

I decided on a color combination and added the colors easily and was able to change when needed by adding the function to the root which is a huge time saver.

Gave the portfolio a max-width of 600px so it can align properly when the portfolio is opened to a smaller screen like a phone or ipad. Flexbox made this possible of course and flexbox and media queiry are extreamly helpful when it comes to making a page responsive.

I did have trouble with the project image since the image sizes were different but I was able to convert the dimension and type of the image using google.

I don't have any link for run-buddy project because I still did not finish it and didn't make a link for it. But Horiseon was properly added and is functional.

I used media queiry for the first time and it was so easily to understand that I am looking forward to work with it more. But I will be honest, flexbox is my favorite and a game changer.
